Look at the projects in this order, and read the comments I put in each:

1. XkcdConsoleVersion -- look at the Program.cs and read the comments

2. XkcdConsoleVersion2 -- look at the Program.cs. Notice how now I'm using a class. Notice the similarity to working with databases!

3. XkcdDemo -- this is an MVC app. Look at the similarity to XkcdConsoleVersion2. I included the same class. Look at the Home/Index controller action; then look at its view, including how I used the image URL.
